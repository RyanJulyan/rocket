# Worksheet:

## Step 1: What are you offering?
For a more in depth approach to crafting your offer, consider reviewing Alex Hormozi's approach to [_Creating Grand Slam Offers_](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/03_design_and_documentation_phase/quickstarts/offer_creation.md#offer-creation)

### Choose one area below and describe the problem you will solve:
- **Pain**: A problem you've personally experienced and overcome.
- **Profession**: A challenge related to your profession.
- **Passion**: An issue you're passionate about solving.

| Category (Choose One)       | Problem You Will Solve (be specific) |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Pain / Profession / Passion |                                      |

## Step 2: Identify Who you will be selling to

### Targeting a clearly defined group ensures you can connect with them and tailor your message effectively. Consider:
- **Who is like you:** Similar Job, Situation (Mom with many kids etc) 
- **Who have you helped before:** At work, Friends, Family charged before or helped because you have the skillset
- **Who is underserved:** Others are not really serving or addressing their problems

### Choose your audience, and describe their characteristics:

| Group (Choose One)                     | Description |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Like You / Helped Before / Underserved |             |

### Beyond Who: Create an Ideal Customer Profile (IDP)

| Attribute              | Answer |
| ---------------------- | ------ |
| Age                    |        |
| Gender                 |        |
| Profession / Situation |        |
| Problem                |        |
| Interests              |        |

### Write these attributes into a coherent sentence:

\
\_\_***{age}***\_\_ \_\_***{gender}***\_\_ who are \_\_***{Profession/Situation}***\_\_, facing challenges with \_\_***{Problem}***\_\_ and enjoy \_\_***{Interests}***\_\_ 


| Ideal Customer Profile (IDP): | ____ |
| ----------------------------- | ---- |

## Step 3: How will you highlight the benifits

### Pt 1. Focus on the Upside (Result/Experience)
| Question                                                     | Answer |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------ |
| Describe how much easier their life will  be.                |        |
| What guaranteed outcome can you provide?                     |        |
| Describe how much faster they will achieve results.          |        |
| Describe how it  will feel for them to experience the dream. |        |

### Pt 2. Focus on Negative (Avoidance/Pain)
| Question                                                                | Answer |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| What risks will they avoid by choosing you (opposite of guarantee)?     |        |
| How slow is their current situation (opposite of faster)?               |        |
| What pain and suffering do they endure now that your system eliminates? |        |

| List (unordered)/Steps (ordered) to achieve the outcome:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |        |
