# Automated Emails

No marketing plan is complete without an automated email campaign.

The there are typically four types of emails that you can begin sending to your new leads:
- [ ] “Thank you” and what a prospect can expect from you now that they’ve signed up for our email list
- [ ] Overcome the biggest objection people have to doing business with you (i.e. “you’re too expensive” or “it won’t work for me because…”)
- [ ] A testimonial from somebody who has had success using your product
- [ ] A direct sales letter offering a limited-time deal

This is a suitable place to start if you’re just getting your business set up or you have limited experience in marketing. however these should grow with you and the company.

And that’s all we want from a simple checklist, right?
