# Automated Emails

No marketing plan is complete without an automated email campaign.

There are typically four types of emails that you can begin sending to your new leads:
- [ ] “Thank you” and what a prospect can expect from you now that they’ve signed up for our email list
- [ ] Overcome the biggest objection people have to doing business with you (i.e. “you’re too expensive” or “it won’t work for me because…”)
- [ ] A testimonial from somebody who has had success using your product
- [ ] A direct sales letter offering "a limited-time deal" / "up-sale" / "support"

Do not underestimate the offer to support them and help them reach their personal goals, especially when you are a new company. This will set you apart from your competitors.

This is a suitable place to start if you’re getting your business set up or have limited marketing experience. However, these should grow with you and the company.

And that’s all we want from a simple checklist, right?
