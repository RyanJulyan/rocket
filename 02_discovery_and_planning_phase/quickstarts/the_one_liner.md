# The One-Liner
The one-liner is the foundational piece to building a marketing brand and funnel.

If you’re familiar with the one-liner, you know that it’s made up of three parts.

1. Problem
1. Solution
1. Results

Your one-liner is simply a 1-2 sentence description of the **problem** your business solves, the **solution** it offers to customers (your product/service), and the **results** customers can expect from using your product/service.

That’s it!

So, next time someone asks you what you do, give them your one-liner. This is an easy way to get them interested in what you do.

If they’re interested, you can direct them to your [website](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/02_discovery_and_planning_phase/quickstarts/website.md).
