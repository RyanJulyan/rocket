# Website
With your one-liner set, now it’s time to set your sights on some of your marketing assets. Beginning with your website.

However, if this is the first time you do this, you may need to know where to start with the website wireframe.

Below is the suggested checklist to get you kick-started:
- [ ] **Header**
  - Use a few enticing/catchy words to describe your offering at the top of your website.
- [ ] **Explain the Stakes with Loss-Aversion**
  - Describe the unpleasant situation that your product will help customers avoid.
- [ ] **Guide Positioning**
  - Present your company as the response to consumer issues. You should speak with a firm yet sympathetic tone.
- [ ] **Value proposition**
  - Describe how your service or product will add value by listing its advantages.
  - Compare scenes of satisfied customers using your product with daily life without it.
- [ ] **Plan**
  - _Provide your customer with a simple path that shows how simple it is to do business with you._
  - **THREE-STEP PROCESS PLAN:** What are the three steps your customer can take to do business with you? Keep it simple. Only use a few words for each step.
    - Each step of the plan should be accompanied by a statement that describes the benefit for the customer, not just the tasks.
      - e.g. Instead of just **“Step 1: Schedule a Call”**, rather describe what benefits the customer will experience from that step. It could be something like this: **"Step 1: SCHEDULE A CALL: This allows us to get aligned around your vision and goals for the project."**
- [ ] **Explanatory Paragraph**
  - Tell an engaging, SEO-friendly story that ties your target audience to your company.
    - Find out what your customers want in order to establish a stronger connection with them.
      - Who do they hope to develop into?
- [ ] **Video** _(Optional)_
  - You can optionally include a branded video to give your message more life. Your video serves as a sales pitch to win over potential clients.
- [ ] **[Lead-Generator](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/02_discovery_and_planning_phase/quickstarts/lead_generator.md)**
  - With the help of a lead generation campaign, you can request email addresses from potential customers by promising to send them more information on a topic that interests them.
  - People are likelier to develop trusting relationships with you if you provide free value first.
  - To stand out from the competition and establish your brand as an authority or resource in your market, a lead generator should have a fascinating title, target a particular audience, solve the problems of your target customers to earn their trust, and elicit feelings of reciprocity. 
- [ ] **Divisions of Your Company** _(Optional)_
  - What’s interesting is the inclusion of the divisions of the company piece.
  - If you run a large company with many divisions, you’ll be happy to see that you can fit them onto your website's home page. You can leave this section out if you do not have different divisions.
- [ ] **Price Choices**
  - Indicate the cost of your goods or services, as appropriate.
- [ ] **Junk Drawer**
  - Any additional links or information about your company (Careers Page, Terms and Conditions, FAQs, Blog, etc).

Do not feel pressured into including all parts, e.g. Divisions of Your Company, if you do not have them. This is your website; let this help you, not control you. However, If you run a large company with many divisions, you’ll be happy to see that you can fit them onto your website's home page.

With a website plan in place, you’ll need to create a plan for obtaining leads (to include on your website).

That’s where the [lead generator](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/02_discovery_and_planning_phase/quickstarts/lead_generator.md) comes in.
