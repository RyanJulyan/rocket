# Website
With your one-liner set, now it’s time to set your sights on some of your marketing assets. Beginning with your website.

Donald Miller and Dr. J.J. Peterson’s Marketing Made Simple, suggests using a website wireframing process.

However, if you have never done this before, you may not know where to start with the website wireframe.

Below is the suggested checklist to get you kickstrated:

- [ ] Header
- [ ] Loss-Aversion
- [ ] Guide Positioning
- [ ] Divisions of Your Company
- [ ] Lead-Generator
- [ ] Explanatory Paragraph
- [ ] Plan
- [ ] Junk Drawer

If you’re familiar with the Marketing Made Simple framework, most of these pieces will look familiar to you if not, do not feel pressured into including all parts e.g. Divisions of Your Company if you do not have them. This is your website, let this help you, not control you. However, If you run a large company with many divisions, you’ll be happy to see that you can fit them onto your website's home page.

With a website plan in place, you’ll need to create a plan for obtaining leads.

That’s where the [lead generator](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/02_discovery_and_planning_phase/quickstarts/lead_generator.md) comes in.
