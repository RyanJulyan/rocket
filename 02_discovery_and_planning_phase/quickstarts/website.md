# Website
With your one-liner set, now it’s time to set your sights on some of your marketing assets. Beginning with your website.

Donald Miller and Dr. J.J. Peterson’s Marketing Made Simple, suggests using a website wireframing process.

However, if this is your first time doing this, you may need to know where to start with the website wireframe.

Below is the suggested checklist to get you kick-started:

- [ ] **Header**
- [ ] **Loss-Aversion**
- [ ] **Guide Positioning**
- [ ] **Divisions of Your Company**
- [ ] **Lead-Generator**
- [ ] **Explanatory Paragraph**
  - 
- [ ] **Plan**
  - _Provide your customer with a simple path that shows how simple it is to do business with you._
  - **THREE-STEP PROCESS PLAN:** What are the three steps your customer can take to do business with you? Keep it simple. Only use a few words for each step.
    - Each step of the plan should be accompanied by a statement that describes the benefit for the customer, not just the tasks.
      - e.g. Instead of just **“Step 1: Schedule a Call”**, rather describe what benefits the customer will experience from that step. It could be something like this: **"Step 1: SCHEDULE A CALL: This allows us to get aligned around your vision and goals for the project."**
- [ ] **Junk Drawer**
  - Any additional links or information about your company (Careers Page, Terms and Conditions, FAQs, Blog, etc).

If you’re familiar with the Marketing Made Simple framework, most of these pieces will look familiar to you if not, do not feel pressured into including all parts e.g. Divisions of Your Company if you do not have them. This is your website, let this help you, not control you. However, If you run a large company with many divisions, you’ll be happy to see that you can fit them onto your website's home page.

With a website plan in place, you’ll need to create a plan for obtaining leads.

That’s where the [lead generator](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/02_discovery_and_planning_phase/quickstarts/lead_generator.md) comes in.
