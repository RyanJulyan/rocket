# Lead-Generator
A complete solution to a narrow problem given away at a significant discount (or free) to attract ideal customers
- Builds trust on you/your deliver and follow through
- Should lead to the "next problem" which your "Core offer" should then solve/address
- Becuase they now trust you, they are more likely to buy from you

> **NB:** Do not make the Lead Magnet Fluff!
- Market judges you on your FREE stuff not paid 
- People buy based on expectation of future value. Easiest way to get them to think they'll get value after they buy is...provide value before they buy. 

## A Great Lead Magnet:
- Engages Ideal Customer When they See it
- Gets more users to engage than your core offer alone
- A complete solution to a narrow problem (e.g. Step 1 of X)
- Is Valuable Enough people Actually Use/Consume it
- Over Deliver on the promise of the Lead Magnet
- Makes the Right people more likely to buy

The lead generator (or lead magnet) is intended to support you by enticing users to give you their contact information, e.g. email. If you are not sure where to start this checklist gives us a few options to consider that we can create for a lead generator:

- [ ] A PDF with a catchy title that positions you as an expert in your area of expertise
- [ ] A webinar
- [ ] A short, educational, video series
- [ ] A graphic
- [ ] A document
- [ ] An infographic
- [ ] A template

These are the surface level but do not tell you what to put in them, how or who these are targeted at! the goal is to give away value, **a lot of value**, for more details on how to create these leads, please refer to: [Leads](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/03_design_and_documentation_phase/quickstarts/leads.md#leads)

Really, a lead generator/lead magnet can be any piece of content that you give to a prospect in exchange for their contact information. But make sure it is relevant and shows you are competent.

Whatever content you are creating, consider applying the **AIDA** model. AIDA breaks down into the steps required for successful marketing: 
1. **A**ttention
1. **I**nterest
1. **D**esire (or, in some variations, Decision)
1. **A**ction.

The AIDA marketing model is a cornerstone of modern marketing, to the extent that missing one step is thought to almost guarantee an unsuccessful result.

If you are not sure where to start; a PDF, webinar, infographic, template or video series is a wonderful place to start with a lead generator, especially if you don’t have much experience creating one. Think about giving away a spreadsheet you use to complete/track your work or something you personally have tried and tested, and just package that.

Once you have acquired a lead, then it’s time to warm them up to your brand with [automated emails](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/02_discovery_and_planning_phase/quickstarts/automated_emails.md).
