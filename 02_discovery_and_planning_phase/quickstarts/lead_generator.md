# Lead-Generator
The lead generator (or lead magnet) is intended to support you by enticing users to give you their contact information, e.g. email. If you are not sure where to start checklist gives us a few options to consider that we can create for a lead generator:

- [ ] A PDF with a catchy title that positions you as an expert in your area of expertise
- [ ] A webinar
- [ ] A short, educational, video series
- [ ] A graphic
- [ ] A document
- [ ] An infographic
- [ ] A template

Really, a lead generator can be any piece of content that you give to a prospect in exchange for their contact information. But make sure it is relevant and shows you are competent.

Whatever content you are creating, consider applying the **AIDA** model. AIDA breaks down into the steps required for successful marketing: 
1. **A**ttention
1. **I**nterest
1. **D**esire (or, in some variations, Decision)
1. **A**ction.

The AIDA marketing model is a cornerstone of modern marketing, to the extent that missing one step is thought to almost guarantee an unsuccessful result.

But a PDF, webinar, infographic, template or video series is a wonderful place to start with a lead generator, especially if you don’t have much experience creating one.

Once you have acquired a lead, then it’s time to warm them up to your brand with [automated emails](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/02_discovery_and_planning_phase/quickstarts/automated_emails.md).
