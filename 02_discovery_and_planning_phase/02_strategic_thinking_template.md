## Develop a Vision
A vision statement outlines an organization's goals for the future and provides a framework for strategic planning. It is meant to inspire and guide the organization's direction. Here are a few templates and general guidelines to consider:

### Guidelines for Writing a Vision Statement:
- **Be Concise**: A vision statement should be clear and succinct, typically one to two sentences long.
- **Be Inspirational**: It should inspire employees, stakeholders, and customers by presenting an exciting future.
- **Be Aspirational**: Aim high and describe a future that's better than the current state.
- **Be Clear**: Use clear, jargon-free language that is easy to understand.
- **Focus on Impact**: Highlight the positive impact on customers, society, or the industry.
- **Reflect Core Values**: Ensure it aligns with your organization's core values and culture.

### Basic Template
> **[Organization Name]** aims to become **[description of future state]** by **[time frame]** through **[actions, strategies, or values]**.

### Action-Oriented Template
> We will **[action verb]** to achieve **[specific goal]** so that **[outcome]**.

### Value-Focused Template
> At **[Organization Name]**, we envision a world where **[core values]** lead to **[desired outcome]**, making **[impact area]** better for everyone.

### Future State Description
> **[Organization Name]**: Where **[specific feature or achievement]** is the standard, **[problem]** is solved, and **[benefit to stakeholders]**.

### Innovation-Driven Template
> **[Organization Name]** will redefine **[industry or sector]** by **[innovative approach]**, setting new standards for **[what will be achieved]**.

Remember, a vision statement is not static. It can evolve as the organization's goals and the external environment change. It's important to revisit and, if necessary, revise the vision statement periodically to ensure it remains relevant and motivating.
