## What is Design Thinking?
Design Thinking is a set of principles that helps you go from an idea right the way through to a testable prototype, with the user's needs at the center of every decision. By the end, you’ll have a working prototype that you can test on your phone or in a browser.

> _“User-centered design means understanding what your users need, how they think, and how they behave – and incorporating that understanding into every aspect of your process."_ Jesse James Garrett — User Experience Designer

1. **Implement:** Define the next steps!
    - **In Depth Project Plan:** Take your prototypes and feedback to the next level. Build something "Real"

## Empathise with people
Know the people you are designing for, so you can understand their needs better. Develop empathy towards your potential end-user and will be the guiding light when you move toward brainstorming solutions. Empathy is at the heart of great design. Without it, the solutions you create can never truly solve the problems of your users.

### Define the user you are designing for
The purpose of this profile is to frame all of your ideas and solutions around the individual that is most likely to use it.
- [ ] Pick one user to profile for this workshop (you can always come back and profile others)
- [ ] Capture the basic details about the person you are designing for and build a deeper understanding of their personality, wants and needs.
- [ ] Imagine what your end-user spends their day doing. What do they prioritise? What do they care about? You can then use this to design something that fits into their daily routine.

### Understand The Users Motivation
#### The Challenges with Function-Focused Design
Most systems are “function-focused,” designed to get the job done quickly. This is like a factory that assumes its workers will do their jobs because they are required to. However, Human-Focused Design remembers that people in a system have feelings, insecurities, and reasons why they want or do not want to do certain things, and therefore optimizes their feelings, motivations, and engagement.

Framework called Octalysis, designed as an octagon shape with 8 Core Drives representing each side.

## Define a challenge
The big, meaty problem you want to solve for your business, customer and end-user. Using what you learned in the last stage, it's time to discover a pain point to form a clear challenge that you can tackle.
- [ ] **It's all about the end-user:** Remember this is more about the people you're trying to help than technology
- [ ] **Keep it focused:** Make sure the problem you are trying to tackle isn't too broad or vague
- [ ] **Check it against the Empathise stage:** Refer back to the user profile to make sure you're on the right track.

### Rules and Best Practices
- [ ] No Criticism: Avoid judging ideas during the initial generation phase.
- [ ] Encourage Wild Ideas: Think outside the box and welcome unconventional thoughts.
- [ ] Build on Others' Ideas: Use other ideas as a springboard for further creativity.
- [ ] Quantity Over Quality: Focus on generating as many ideas as possible.
- [ ] Equal Participation: Ensure everyone has a chance to contribute.
- [ ] Stay Focused: Keep the discussion relevant to the topic.
- [ ] Time Management: Adhere to the time allocated for each phase.

### Choose your challenge
- [ ] Define the problem you are trying to solve for the end-user and why it’s going to be important to them. Keep referring back to this as you go.
- [ ] Generate ideas that might be useful to the end-user.
    - The goal of ideation is to rapidly create enough simple and crazy ideas that apply to the problem so you can have a discussion to pick the best one.

_Put yourself in the specific users shoes and answer the following questions._

> NOTE: This section is optional and meant as a guide to help you and the audience think about daily challenges, identify common issues and spark ideas. They can also form the basis for questions to ask your users directly if you have access to them.

### Ideas list

#### Identify Internal Solutions list
> **NOTE:** Internal systems can have negative connotations. You may need to facilitate the focus to be on learning over feelings. Be sensitive as people in the session could have worked on them and been hurt/burned during the process

#### Identify External Solutions list
> **NOTE:** If your team/audience is inexperienced, give them this task as a task to do/prep before the session; when doing this live, people get nervous because many people will believe it is a competition to find the "best" solution. Removing this pressure results in better outcomes.

### List the user needs and features
Many people mistake ideas as features. Bring the ideas back to features by focusing on the user again. This forces you to apply the ideas you created to real user needs. How many solve the problem your user is facing?

| Our target user needs to be able to:      | Therefore our design needs to be abke to: | Feature Name                              |

|-----------------|--------|---------------|----------------|----------------|
| **IMPACT**      |        |               |                |                |
| **HIGH**        |        | _Iteration 1_ | _Iteration 2_  | _Iteration 2_  |
| **MEDIUM**      |        | _Iteration 1_ | _Iteration 3_  | _Iteration 3_  |
| **LOW**         |        | _Iteration 1_ | _Deprioritise_ | _Deprioritise_ |

## Prototype your design
Turn ideas into realistic mockups that you can test. Bring your ideas to life and create interactive prototypes, for mobile or web, using Rapid prototyping. The best way to test ideas with users and start a conversation is to show them how the solution works. 

### Create an elevator pitch:
You need to be able to quickly and concisely tell people about your product/service. There are some simple _“formulas”_ that will assist you in writing an elevator pitch if you are asked what you do or what your business is; having a quick a one-sentence answer is a great way to respond:
- You know how **[state the problem]**, we solve that by **[state your solution]**. We have done this before **[give examples]**
- We help **[insert ideal client]** achieve **[insert what you help them do]** through **[insert methodology]**
- We **[insert what you help them do]** by **[insert methodology]** for **[insert ideal client]**

### Types of Prototypes / MVP's
You do not have to create a 100% working product right away, first time. Start small and work your way up. Here are some examples of simple, easy and low budget MVP’s that you could apply to your idea, regardless of what your product is:

### Faking it
Not a real product. You can think of this as testing the idea without a prototype. e.g.:

|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Crowdsourcing | - Asking to put money behind you / your idea                       | - Oculus Rift (raised funds on Kickstarter)         |
| Landing Page  | - A place for people to go to show interest and sign up            | - Groupon (used landing page to validate idea)      |
| Shell App     | - Example app that may not work 100%. (these can even be sketches) | - Zappos (started with a website without inventory) |

Each of these companies used the MVP strategy listed to test their market viability and refine their product ideas before fully committing to development.

## Test your design
### Checklist
Share your prototype and gain invaluable feedback from the people that matter.
- [ ] Test your prototype with your end user or simply others in the room
    - [ ] Give them the sales [pitch](#create-an-elevator-pitch) before using the prototype!
    - [ ] Don’t interrupt or try to take over, watch and learn!
- [ ] Observe your user's reactions and behaviour with the prototype without giving instructions.
    - [ ] Identify where they hit issues or look confused
    - [ ] Gather feedback that can be used to iterate and improve the experience.

### Review the prototype with users
The Five Act Interview from the book "Sprint" by Jake Knapp is a structured process used in design sprints to extract high-quality feedback from interviews. Here are the detailed steps:
1. **Friendly Welcome**: Start by building rapport with the interviewee. Make them feel comfortable and establish a friendly, conversational tone.
    - **Example:** _"Hi [Interviewee's Name], thank you so much for joining us today! We really appreciate you taking the time to help us. How has your day been so far?"_
1. **Context Questions**: Begin the interview with broad, open-ended questions about the interviewee's background, experiences, and opinions related to the topic at hand. This helps to understand their perspective and gather context.
    - **Example:** _"Can you tell us a bit about your experience with [relevant topic or product]? What do you typically look for in a product like this? How often do you use such products or services?"_
1. **Introduction to the Prototype**: Introduce the prototype or concept you're testing. Explain that you're looking for honest feedback and that the prototype is a work in progress. This sets the stage for the user to be open and candid.
    - **Example:** _"We're excited to show you a prototype we've been working on. It's still in the early stages, so your honest thoughts are incredibly valuable to us. Remember, there are no right or wrong answers here. We're just interested in your perspective."_
    - - **NB:** Ensure you say: _"You are not being tested. The prototype is, so we are looking for honest feedback"_ and _"I did not work on this; I am just here to understand your experiences"_ (as people are worried about offending people when giving feedback) 
1. **Tasks and Open-Ended Questions**: Guide the interviewee through specific tasks using the prototype. Ask open-ended questions to encourage them to express their thoughts and feelings as they interact with the prototype. Observe their behaviour and reactions.
    - **Example:** _"How would you typically approach [a specific task]?"_
    - **Example during process:** _"What are you thinking about? What Comes to mind"_
1. **Quick Debrief**: Conclude the interview by summarizing what was learned and asking any final questions. Thank the interviewee for their time and insights. This helps gather any last important thoughts and signals the end of the session.
    - **Example:** _"Thank you for going through the prototype with us. To summarize, it sounds like you found [certain feature] quite useful but had some concerns about [another aspect]. Is there anything else you'd like to add? Again, thank you so much for your time and insights."_

Throughout the interview, it's crucial to listen actively, take notes, and avoid leading the interviewee or biasing their responses. The aim is to gather genuine user reactions and insights. To avoid leading questions, build a script you can fall back on, and:
- Focus on questions that start with: "who", "what", "when", "why", "where" and "how".
- Avoid: "yes"/"no" questions and "multiple choice"/"options" questions

### Take the elevator pitch to the next level to create a story:
1. Start with the problem you help overcome (more generic situation/framing)
1. Make the problem even worse (specific, personal and emotional hook)
1. Position the company or solution/product as the resolution (what you offer)
1. Describe a happy ending (because of your support)

Your storyline becomes the **“why”** for the team and client
- Reference the storyline in each phase to make sure you are addressing the problem
- This story can be used in Advertising and speeches alike.

### Rewards:
#### Should Not Always be Money / Stuff
- Rewards shift focus from intrinsic to extrinsic 
- Meaning that the Reward = reason for activity
- Therefore If reward is stopped;
    - Quality/Engagement drops
    - Interest drops
> Solution Unexpected reward, not say when or why, this shows appreciation and shows recognition.
