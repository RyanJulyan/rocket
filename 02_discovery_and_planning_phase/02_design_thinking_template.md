## What is Design Thinking?
Design Thinking is a set of principles that helps you go from an idea right the way through to a testable prototype, with the user's needs at the center of every decision. By the end, you’ll have a working prototype that you can test on your phone or in a browser.

> _“User-centered design means understanding what your users need, how they think, and how they behave – and incorporating that understanding into every aspect of your process."_ Jesse James Garrett — User Experience Designer

1. **[Prototype](#prototype-your-design):** Aim to use 50% of your session time
    - **Prototype your design:** Create a user flow and turn your ideas into interactive mockups.
1. **[Test](#test-your-design):** Aim to use 20% of your session time
    - **Test your design:** Take your prototypes to your audience and get feedback.
1. **Present:** It’s now time to share your project!
    - **Discuss and Get Feedback:** Think about pro's and con's of each teams feedback
1. **Implement:** Define the next steps!
    - **In Depth Project Plan:** Take your prototypes and feedback to the next level. Build something "Real"

## Empathise with people
Know the people you are designing for, so you can understand their needs better. Develop empathy towards your potential end-user and will be the guiding light when you move toward brainstorming solutions. Empathy is at the heart of great design. Without it, the solutions you create can never truly solve the problems of your users.

### Define the user you are designing for
The purpose of this profile is to frame all of your ideas and solutions around the individual that is most likely to use it.
- [ ] Pick one user to profile for this workshop (you can always come back and profile others)
- [ ] Capture the basic details about the person you are designing for and build a deeper understanding of their personality, wants and needs.
- [ ] Imagine what your end-user spends their day doing. What do they prioritise? What do they care about? You can then use this to design something that fits into their daily routine.

## Define a challenge
The big, meaty problem you want to solve for your business, customer and end-user. Using what you learned in the last stage, it's time to discover a pain point to form a clear challenge that you can tackle.
- [ ] **It's all about the end-user:** Remember this is more about the people you're trying to help than technology
- [ ] **Keep it focused:** Make sure the problem you are trying to tackle isn't too broad or vague
- [ ] **Check it against the Empathise stage:** Refer back to the user profile to make sure you're on the right track.

### Rules and Best Practices
- [ ] No Criticism: Avoid judging ideas during the initial generation phase.
- [ ] Encourage Wild Ideas: Think outside the box and welcome unconventional thoughts.
- [ ] Build on Others' Ideas: Use other ideas as a springboard for further creativity.
- [ ] Quantity Over Quality: Focus on generating as many ideas as possible.
- [ ] Equal Participation: Ensure everyone has a chance to contribute.
- [ ] Stay Focused: Keep the discussion relevant to the topic.
- [ ] Time Management: Adhere to the time allocated for each phase.

### Choose your challenge
- [ ] Define the problem you are trying to solve for the end-user and why it’s going to be important to them. Keep referring back to this as you go.
- [ ] Generate ideas that might be useful to the end-user.
    - The goal of ideation is to rapidly create enough simple and crazy ideas that apply to the problem so you can have a discussion to pick the best one.

## Prototype your design
Turn ideas into realistic mockups that you can test. Bring your ideas to life and create interactive prototypes, for mobile or web, using Rapid prototyping. The best way to test ideas with users and start a conversation is to show them how the solution works. 

### Create an elevator pitch:
You need to be able to quickly and concisely tell people about your product/service. There are some simple _“formulas”_ that will assist you in writing an elevator pitch if you are asked what you do or what your business is; having a quick a one-sentence answer is a great way to respond:
- You know how **[state the problem]**, we solve that by **[state your solution]**. We have done this before **[give examples]**
- We help **[insert ideal client]** achieve **[insert what you help them do]** through **[insert methodology]**
- We **[insert what you help them do]** by **[insert methodology]** for **[insert ideal client]**

### Types of Prototypes / MVP's

You do not have to create a 100% working product right away, first time. Start small and work your way up. Here are some examples of simple, easy and low budget MVP’s that you could apply to your idea, regardless of what your product is:

### Faking it
Not a real product. You can think of this as testing the idea without a prototype. e.g.:

| What      | Examples                                                             |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Survey    | - Google Forms<br/>- Survey monkey<br/>- Social Media                |
| Advert    | - Email Validations<br/>- Flyers to hand out<br/>- Social Media Post |
| Explainer | - Explainer Video<br/>- Infographic<br/>- Social Media Post          |

### Making it
You may need to create something closer to a real product / prototype. e.g.:

| What          | Examples                                                           |
|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Crowdsourcing | - Asking to put money behind you / your idea                       |
| Landing Page  | - A place for people to go to show interest and sign up            |
| Shell App     | - Example app that may not work 100%. (these can even be sketches) |

### Sketching
Sketching on the paper templates provided or use prototyping tools to design and wireframe, then it's a simple few clicks to make everything interactive.
- [ ] Just start building, don't get hung up on visuals
- [ ] Don't spend too much time on one idea - move fast!
- [ ] Design only the screens that matter for testing
- [ ] Prototyping tools such as:
    - [ ] [Penpot](https://penpot.app/)
    - [ ] [Marvel App](https://marvelapp.com/)
    - [ ] [Wireframe.cc](https://wireframe.cc/)
    - [ ] [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

### Sketch your app or feature, then take photos
| Sketch Name: {sketch_name}                                                                                                                                                            |

## Test your design
Share your prototype and gain invaluable feedback from the people that matter.
- [ ] Test your prototype with your end user or simply others in the room
    - [ ] Give them the sales [pitch](#create-an-elevator-pitch) before using the prototype!
    - [ ] Don’t interrupt or try to take over, watch and learn!
- [ ] Observe your user's reactions and behaviour with the prototype without giving instructions.
    - [ ] Identify where they hit issues or look confused
    - [ ] Gather feedback that can be used to iterate and improve the experience.

### Evaluate your prototype

## Next Steps
Decide on the best ideas (don't be afraid to mix and match). Lets build a [One-page Business Plan](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/03_design_and_documentation_phase/00_one_page_business_plan.md)

#### Take the elevator pitch to the next level to create a story:
1. Start with the problem you help overcome (more generic situation/framing)
1. Make the problem even worse (specific, personal and emotional hook)
1. Position the company or solution/product as the resolution (what you offer)
1. Describe a happy ending (because of your support)

Your storyline becomes the **“why”** for the team and client
- Reference the storyline in each phase to make sure you are addressing the problem
- This story can be used in Advertising and speeches alike.
