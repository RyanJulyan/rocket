### What is Design Thinking?
Design Thinking is a set of principles that helps you go from an idea right the way through to a testable prototype, with the user's needs at the center of every decision.

> _“User-centered design means understanding what your users need, how they think, and how they behave – and incorporating that understanding into every aspect of your process."_ Jesse James Garrett — User Experience Designer

### Empathise with people
Know the people you are designing for, so you can understand their needs better. Develop empathy towards your potential end-user and will be the guiding light when you move toward brainstorming solutions. Empathy is at the heart of great design. Without it, the solutions you create can never truly solve the problems of your users.

### Define the user you are designing for
- The purpose of this profile is to frame all of your ideas and solutions around the individual that is most likely to use it.
- [ ] Capture the basic details about the person you are designing for and build a deeper understanding of their personality, wants and needs.
- [ ] Imagine what your end-user spends their day doing. What do they prioritise? What do they care about? You can then use this to design something that fits into their daily routine.

### Define a challenge
The big, meaty problem you want to solve for your business, customer and end-user. Using what you learned in the last stage, it's time to discover a pain point to form a clear challenge that you can tackle.
- [ ] **It's all about the end-user:** Remember this is more about the people you're trying to help than technology
- [ ] **Keep it focused:** Make sure the problem you are trying to tackle isn't too broad or vague
- [ ] **Check it against the Empathise stage:** Refer back to the user profile to make sure you're on the right track.

### Choose your challenge
- [ ] Define the problem you are trying to solve for the end-user and why it’s going to be important to them. Keep referring back to this as you go.
- [ ] Generate ideas that might be useful to the end-user.
    - The goal of ideation is to rapidly create enough simple and crazy ideas that apply to the problem so you can have a discussion to pick the best one.

#### What problem are you trying to solve for your end user?
- [...]
#### Why is this important to them?
- [...]

#### Ideate possibilities
- Generate as many ideas as possible
- Even the craziest ideas count!
- Anchor everything to the user profile and problems you defined in the previous stages
