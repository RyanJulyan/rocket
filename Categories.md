Your process is indeed quite comprehensive, and while it's detailed, it could be overwhelming to communicate to stakeholders who may not be familiar with such in-depth workflows. To simplify this without losing any detail, we can cluster related steps into phases and streamline the language. Here's a revised, simplified workflow:

1. **Initiation Phase:**
   - **Client Briefing:** Understand client objectives and requirements.
   - **Team Assembly:** Select appropriate agency and client team members.

2. **Discovery & Planning Phase:**
   - **Discovery Workshops:** Conduct in-depth, immersive workshops to explore project needs.
   - **Design Document Development:**
     - Complete the Design Document during the workshop.
     - Client reviews and provides feedback on the Design Document.
     - Hold ad-hoc meetings as needed to refine the Design Document.
   - **Technical and Data Specifications:**
     - Draft Technical Design Documents and Data Specifications.
     - Client reviews and provides feedback on these documents.

3. **Design & Documentation Phase:**
   - **Business Metrics & User Analysis:**
     - Establish SMART business metrics.
     - Define user types and desired actions.
     - Map user actions to business metrics.
   - **Process and Feature Definition:**
     - Outline high-level process flows and feature priorities.
     - Document assumptions, dependencies, and detailed feature descriptions.
   - **Approval Milestones:**
     - Obtain sign-off on the Design Document, Technical Design Documents, and Data Specifications.

4. **Development Preparation Phase:**
   - **Refinement of Technical Design:**
     - Refine technical designs using the 4+1 model views.
   - **Data Specification Detailing:**
     - Define data governance, schema, and model.
     - Create a Data Factory with fake data stubs.
     - Draft UI views and wireframes, ensuring data adequacy.

5. **Implementation Phase:**
   - **Build Prototypes and Products:**
     - Develop UI, API, and data pipelines as per the project stage (POC, MVP, Full Features).
   - **Testing & Validation:**
     - Conduct unit, user acceptance, and load testing.
     - Compile Functional Testing Reports.
   - **Business Impact Analysis:**
     - Create a Business Validation Report linking development to business metrics.
     - Analyze costs and validate against business objectives.

6. **Review & Handover Phase:**
   - **Documentation & Training:**
     - Update the Design Document with new features.
     - Compile a list of future features/issues and lessons learned.
   - **Client Workshops:** Conduct workshops to introduce new features.
   - **Final Approvals:**
     - Obtain sign-off on all deliverables.
   - **Handover:** Transfer all documentation and knowledge to the client.

7. **Evolution Phase:**
   - **Next Level Development:**
     - Based on the feedback and results, begin planning for the next iteration (POC, MVP, or feature enhancements).
   - **Repeat Process:** Follow the same structured process for each new level of development.

By organizing the process into distinct phases and using clearer, less technical language, it becomes easier to follow and communicate while retaining the depth of the original plan.
