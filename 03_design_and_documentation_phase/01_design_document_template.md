### Summary of 4 + 1 Architectural View Model in Software
The 4+1 Architectural View Model is a framework for describing the architecture of software-intensive systems. It was introduced by Philippe Kruchten in 1995 to address the limitations of traditional software architecture diagrams. The model is designed to present multiple views of a system to cater to different stakeholders like end-users, developers, system engineers, and project managers.

#### The Five Views
1. **Logical View**: Focuses on the system's functionality from the end-user's perspective. Class diagrams and state diagrams are often used to represent this view.
1. **Process View**: Addresses the system's run-time behavior, focusing on dynamic elements like processes and their communication. It deals with aspects like concurrency, distribution, and performance.
1. **Development View**: Looks at the system from a programmer's perspective and is concerned with software management. It uses UML Component diagrams and Package diagrams for representation.
1. **Physical View**: Portrays the system from a system engineer's standpoint, focusing on the topology of software components and their physical connections.
1. **Scenarios**: These are the 'plus one' view and are essentially use cases or sequences of interactions that help in understanding, validating, and demonstrating the architecture.

#### Why Each View is Needed
- **Logical View**: Helps in understanding what the system is supposed to do.
- **Process View**: Important for understanding how the system will operate in a real-world environment.
- **Development View**: Crucial for developers for code organization and management.
- **Physical View**: Important for system engineers for deployment considerations.
- **Scenarios**: Useful for validating that the architecture meets the requirements and for initial testing.

| Feature No # | Feature Name           | Description                 | Calculation                 |
|--------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|
| ...          | ....                   | ....                        | ....                        |

   - Prioritization Criteria:
      - Put each feature into one of three categories:
         - Achievable
         - Nice to have
         - Not feasible
      - Define each elementâ€™s difficulty (Diff) as either:
         - Easy
         - Medium
         - Difficult
      - Given the areas Value (V), Cost (C), and Risk (R).
         - Give each area a score out of 10 for Value (V), Cost (C), and Risk (R).
         - Calculate the Priority (P), in which (P) = Value / (Cost + Risk).
   - Phase-wise breakdown of feature implementation

#### Achievable
> *Critical tasks/Quick win/Easy/Valuable*

| Phase   | Feature No # | Feature | Diff    | Value | Cost  | Risk  | Priority              |
|---------|--------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------------|
| ....    | ...          | ....    | ....    | ..    | ..    | ..    | Value / (Cost + Risk) |

#### Nice to have
