### Understanding Requirements
#### Starting Point: Raw Requirements
- Systems design and architecture often start from a raw requirement. This could be from a customer or even an idea you have.
   - *Example Requirement:* "I would like a schooling system that allows students to register for courses and view schedules."

> Merely looking at this requirement might make you miss some details, and there are most likely some assumptions on both sides of the requirement. There is need to break it down further to understand it fully. Modeling and Simulation can help you to do this.

#### Modeling and Simulation
**Objective:** Identify key components (models) and their interactions (verbs) within a given system based on a requirement statement.
- **Identify Nouns:** Mark the nouns in the requirement. These **nouns** represent the **models or components** in the system.
   - *Example:* In the requirement "I would like a schooling system that allows students to register for courses and view schedules," the nouns are "schooling system," "students," "courses," and "schedules."
- **Identify Verbs:** These **verbs** will be the **interactions** or edges that **connect the models** together.
   - *Example:* "Allows" and "register" are verbs that indicate interactions between the models.
- **Create Interactions:** Use the verbs to **create interactions between the models**.
   - *Example:* Students are allowed to enter the schooling system, register for courses, and view schedules.

#### Requirement Statements:
| Req ID   | Requirement Description | Nouns              | Verbs              | Process Flow Step(s) |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| req-.... | ...                     | - ... <br/> - ...  | - ... <br/> - ...  | - ... <br/> - ...    |

#### Requirement Statement Interactions:
| Req ID   | Feature No # | Subject (Noun 1)   | Interaction (Verb) â†’   | Object (Noun 2)    | Users             | Desired Action                    | Associated Business Metrics  |
|----------|--------------|--------------------|:----------------------:|--------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| req-.... | feat-....    | ...                | ...                    | ...                | - ... <br/> - ... | - ... <br/> - ...                 | - ... <br/> - ...            |

**Note:** One requirement (req-....) can lead to multiple features (feat-....). Assign unique Feature No# (e.g., feat-0001, feat-0002) to each feature derived from the same or different requirements.

### Summary of 4 + 1 Architectural View Model in Software
The 4+1 Architectural View Model is a framework for describing the architecture of software-intensive systems. It was introduced by Philippe Kruchten in 1995 to address the limitations of traditional software architecture diagrams. The model is designed to present multiple views of a system to cater to different stakeholders like end-users, developers, system engineers, and project managers.

#### The Five Views
1. **Logical View**: Focuses on the system's functionality from the end-user's perspective. Class diagrams and state diagrams are often used to represent this view.
1. **Process View**: Addresses the system's run-time behavior, focusing on dynamic elements like processes and their communication. It deals with aspects like concurrency, distribution, and performance.
1. **Development View**: Looks at the system from a programmer's perspective and is concerned with software management. It uses UML Component diagrams and Package diagrams for representation.
1. **Physical View**: Portrays the system from a system engineer's standpoint, focusing on the topology of software components and their physical connections.
1. **Scenarios**: These are the 'plus one' view and are essentially use cases or sequences of interactions that help in understanding, validating, and demonstrating the architecture.

#### Why Each View is Needed
- **Logical View**: Helps in understanding what the system is supposed to do.
- **Process View**: Important for understanding how the system will operate in a real-world environment.
- **Development View**: Crucial for developers for code organization and management.
- **Physical View**: Important for system engineers for deployment considerations.
- **Scenarios**: Useful for validating that the architecture meets the requirements and for initial testing.

### Features and Priorities:
**Objective:** Translate the identified components and interactions into specific, actionable features.
   - Feature list with detailed descriptions

| Categoriesed | Feature No # | Feature Group /Module | Feature Name           | Description                 | Calculation (As Required)   | User Story           |
|:------------:|--------------|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|
| [ ]          | feat-....    | ....                  | ....                   | ....                        | ....                        | ....                 |


   - Prioritization Criteria:
      - Put each feature into one of three categories:
         - Achievable
         - Nice to have
         - Not feasible
      - Define each elementâ€™s difficulty (Diff) as either:
         - Easy
         - Medium
         - Difficult
      - Given the areas Value (V), Cost (C), and Risk (R).
         - Give each area a score out of 10 for Value (V), Cost (C), and Risk (R).
         - Calculate the Priority (P), in which (P) = Value / (Cost + Risk).
   - Phase-wise breakdown of feature implementation

#### Achievable
> *Critical tasks/Quick win/Easy/Valuable*

| Phase   | Feature No # | Feature | Diff    | Value | Cost  | Risk  | Priority              | Reason for Categorization | Dependent on Features |
|---------|--------------|---------|---------|-------|-------|-------|-----------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------|
| ....    | feat-....    | ....    | ....    | ..    | ..    | ..    | Value / (Cost + Risk) | [...]                     | - [...]<br/>- [...]   |

#### Nice to have
> *If Enough Time/It would be really cool if*
- Consider moving these to the parking lot as the parkinglot is reviewed more frequemently and after each phase

#### Not feasible
> *Too Expensive/Not Enough Time/Not Valuable Enough*
- Consider moving these to the parking lot as the parkinglot is reviewed more frequemently and after each phase
