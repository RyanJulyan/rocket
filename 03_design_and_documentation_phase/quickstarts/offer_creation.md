# Offer Creation
> Adapted from Alex Hormozi: [OFFER CREATION COURSE](https://www.acquisition.com/training/offers) 

This is suggested to be reviewed after completing the [Design Thinking Template](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/02_discovery_and_planning_phase/03_design_thinking_template.md) as then you will have a better understanding of you client, customer and potential core offering, this will take you to a better understanding of what your offer should include and how to price/charge for it. 

## Goal
More Leads, More Sales, Higher Prices & Profit
Want higher Click Through Rates (CTR), Higher Conversion Rates, Higher Average Ticket Price Value

## Key Aspects

### 1. Market: Are you in the right market
> You want to service a **"Starving Crowd"**
#### 3 Levers
- Market (Growing)
- Offer (Needs to be Compelling and so much better than competitors, price is not a deciding factor)
- Ability to Persuade (Requires skill-set)

#### 4 Factors
- In Pain (Do they desperately want this Right Now)
- Purchasing Power (Can they afford to purchase it? Do they have money?)
- Easy to Target (How do reach them? Is it easy to find them?)
- Growing (Is the market demand growing)

#### 3 Main Markets (these are the "so that they can" have better/more Health, Wealth, Relationships)
> Help a unique avatar (This is for me), 
> Solve a specific problem (I have that issue and need this handled.),
> In a unique way (Your not like everyone else/trying what I already tried),
> That reverses their biggest objection/worry (My biggest risk/objection has been heard and addressed)

> Can you repackage what they are already doing?

1. Health (Likely B2C)
2. Wealth (Likely B2B)
3. Relationships (Likely B2C)

#### Niching
> The goal of great writing is for the reader to understand
> The goal of great copy is for the prospect to feel understood

- Make the Offer/Title Specific to the Avatar (Make them say: "This is made _just_ for me")
- Create a **"Category of 1"** where you are the only one selling this "new category for the product or service" to that specific avatar, which can make it less susceptible to competition.
- Ensure that you overcome the Avatars biggest obstacles
- Speak directly to them!


### 2. Charge What it's Worth:
> Goal is to charge so much more than everyone else that a consumer must pause and think "this cannot be the same _category_ of solution as everyone else" making you/your business/product a **"Category of 1"**

> The more invested the client is, the better the results will be!

#### Price Value
- Price to value discrepancy (Value must be higher than price!)
- 2 ways to solve:
    - Lower price (Which is a loosing battle)
        - Can only go down to 0
    - Increase Value (More willing to pay higher rate)
        - Can go infinitely high

#### Virtuous Cycle
- Don't price for market efficency (Slightly lower than Avg of Competitors, Offering slightly more, leaving no profit)
- **Client**
    | Price Decrease Client Behavior | Client Behavior Area          | Price Increase Client Behavior |
    |--------------------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
    | Decreases                      | Emotional Investment          | Increases                      |
    | Decreases                      | Perceived Value               | Increases                      |
    | Decreases                      | Results                       | Increases                      |
    | Increases                      | Demanding-ness                | Decreases                      |
    | Decreases                      | Revenue for future investment | Increases                      |
- **Business**
    | Price Decrease Business Behavior | Business Behavior Area         | Price Increase Business Behavior |
    |----------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
    | Decreases                        | Profit                         | Increases                        |
    | Decreases                        | Perceived Value of self        | Increases                        |
    | Decreases                        | Perception of Impact (Results) | Increases                        |
    | Decreases                        | Service Levels                 | Increases                        |
    | Decreases                        | Sales Team Conviction          | Increases                        |

#### Correlation between price and perceived value
- High Price = High Value
    - Price therefore is a component of value
    - Client Perceived Value Increases at Higher Ticket Price


### 3. *Value equation:*
- Never charge more than it is worth, always charge more than it cost to produce
- Figure out what clients actually value most. then tripling down on that thing they value, and eliminating everything else.
- **Formula:** $\frac{(\text{Dream Outcome}) \times (\text{Perceived Likelihood of Achievement})} {(\text{Time Delay}) \times (\text{Effort and Sacrifice})} = \text{Value}$

    - Focus on getting the bottom to 0

| Client Value     | Formula Area                           | Focus                                                                                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Increase Value   | Dream Outcome                          | Is the End Result Meaningful Enough?                                                     |
| Increase Value   | Perceived Likelihood of Achievement    | Does the Client Think Your Promise Will Actually Succeed! Do they recognize the Success? |
| Decrease Value   | Time Delay                             | Time to initial result (Progress)? Time to final result? (Can you do it in less time?)   |
| Decrease Value   | Effort & Sacrifice (Suffer to Achieve) | What are the additional costs, efforts and incontinence to achieve result                |


### 4. *Creating Grand Slam Offers:*
#### 3 Parts of the Offer
1. **Outcomes**
    - _Define Their Dream Outcome_
        - Be Specific!
        - Write it out. See how the Avatar responds.
        - Template:
            > I/we help `Model Avatar` Achieve `Specific Outcome` in `Time period` without `Biggest Pain/Fear`
2. **Problems**
    - List out Every Possible Problem they can Encounter
        - Consider Every intricate step
        - Consider Everything that happens before and after achieving their goals
        - What next problem will they face?
    - Map the Problems to the value equation formula area's (`Dream Outcome`, `Perceived Likelihood of Achievement`, `Time Delay`, `Effort & Sacrifice`)
        - **How are you Addressing these challenges?**
            - How can we make it worth it/cheaper?
            - How can we make it easier?
            - How can we make it simpler?
            - How can we make it fun/enjoyable?
            - How can we make it faster?
            - How can we make it sustainable, and something they believe they can do?
    - Does the avatar feel understood by you addressing all the problems they have?
        - Do they think you can solve their problem?
        - Should be adding value.
        - Solving problems others don't talk about.
3. **Solutions**
    - Turn all Problems into Solutions
        - Convert the problem/objection into a process: e.g.
            1. 
             > "How to make `step in process/problem/objection` `worth it/cheaper/easier/simpler/enjoyable/fun/faster` so that anyone can do it/when doing `other activity (traveling/eating out etc...)` (especially `Model Avatar`)
            2. 
             > "How to `Positive outcome that solves a problem` without `Problem/Objection` even if you `GREATEST OBSTACLE` 

    - Repeat `List out Every Possible Problem they can Encounter` for the counters to ensure there are no objections

#### Sales to Fulfillment Continuum
1. Create Flow (Get Money)
2. Monetize Flow (Don't Solve Problems that Don't Exist, Refine/Trim the offer)
3. Then make it harder to sell but easier to Fulfill (Scale)
- 
| Start Here                   | Move |                     To Here |
|:-----------------------------|:----:|----------------------------:|
| üòÅ Easy to Sell              |  ‚Üê  |             Hard to Sell üò≠ |
| üò≠ Hard to Fulfill           |  ‚Üí  |          Easy to Fulfill üòÅ |
| Fewer People at Higher Prices | vs  | More People at Lower Prices |

#### The How (Delivery)
1. **DFY, DWY, DIY**
    - Done For You (DFY)
    - Done With You (DWY)
    - Do It Yourself (DIY)
2. **1:1, Groups, Many**
    - One-on-One (DWY/DIY)
        - Personalized
        - Emotional Support
        - Consider how to implement an option for: `DFY, DWY, DIY`
    - Groups`/`One-to-Many (DFY/DWY)
        - Examples
        - Templates
        - Pre-Existing

    - Community`/`Many-to-Many (DFY/DWY)
        - Groups of Shared interests
        - Community Support
        - Consumption Mediums
        - Consider how to implement an option for: `DFY, DWY, DIY`
3. **Support`/`Many-to-One (DWY/DFY)**
    - Support System
    - Level of Support
4. **Consumption Mediums`/`access**
    - Live
    - Written
    - Audio
    - Video
    - Image
- **Speed & Convince**
    - When do you get back to people (questions/support)
    - How do they each you?
    - How do they interact with the product/service
- **10x the Price**
    - Thinking in a Different Dynamic (Stretch Up) 
    - What else would you do or provide to justify that price and add more value?
        - How can you provide more value
        - What Do you need (infrastructure, tooling, team etc) to deliver on this
- **x/10 the Price**
    - Thinking in a Different Dynamic (Stretch Efficiency) 
    - If you had to provide more value at a 10th of the price, what would you do?
        - Can you add these to your offer anyways?
        - Build once, deliver multiple:
            - Building Assets
            - Building Tools
            - Building Resources
#### Trim and Stack
> Maximize Profit or Value
- **Defining Value**
    - Financially Valuable
    - Cause the Avatar to believe they are likely to succeed
    - Cause the Avatar to feel they can achieve it with much less effort & sacrifice
    - Help the Avatar to acomplish their goals and ensure they see the results with much less time investment
- **Defining Cost**
    - What does it cost to Fulfill the product or service?
    - Try to make sure you sell something you can deliver with 80% or higher gross margins
- **Steps to trim the stack:**
    1. Only pick things that are **High Value**
        - Value Must Go Up if Cost to Company Goes Up (or don't do it)
        - Try to Bring the Cost to Company Down (Without loosing value or even increasing value)
    2. Try Only have 1-to-2 high cost in a single delivery item 
        - Let the highest cost things be for the heaviest hitter


### 5. *Bonuses:*
#### 2 anchors:
1. Pricing
2. This is what you get

What to stretch the prospects mind, and stack value, allowing them to justify the value against the first price and what they get, adding bonuses can give more value
> Bonus is alternative to discounts and should solve all perceived problems
- Split out the offer into multiple things
- Define, offer and "sell" the Core first
- Present bonuses after price is said, i.e. Add additional things you split out over time
    - Fells like they are getting multiple things
    - Stack bonuses instead of discounts to get them to say yes

#### 11 bullets
1. Bonuses should be more valuable than core thing. The value of bonuses should eclipse the value of the original offer, expanding the price to value discrepancy
    - Subconsciously signals that the core thing is meant to be more valuable than the bonuses.
2. Enhance the value of the bonus by adding Scarcity and Urgency, for example:
    - **Scarcity Examples:**
        - Only people who sign up for `XYZ` will have access to bonuses.
            - Bonuses are not for sale and not available anywhere else.
        - Limited stock of Bonus. Buy the last `X` amount of remaining stock.
            - Price is anchored against a different price of the core product
    - **Urgency Urgency:**
        - Contained by time, if you buy `X` now you will get `Y` discount
            - Reward the action of buying by offering a paid bonus (additional product but at a discounted rate as a bundle)
3. Always offer them
4. Give them a special name that has a benefit in the title
5. Tell them: a) How it relates to their issue b) What it is c) What it will do for them d) How it will specifically improve their lives or make their experience: a) faster b) easier or c) less effort/sacrifice (value equation)
6. Provide some proof (this can be a stat, a past client,or personal experience) to prove that this thing is valuable
7. Paint a vivid mental image of what their life willbe like assuming they have already used it and are experiencing the benefits
8. Always ascribe a price tag to them and justify it
9. Tools & checklists are better than additional trainings (as the effort & time are lower with the former, so the value is higher. The value equation still reigns supreme).
10. Bonuses should each **address a specific problem or concern**, and therefore prove they are a benefit. This can also be what they would logically realize they will need next. You want to solve their next problem before they even encounter it.
    - Increases conviction that it works because you are already solving the next problem, and if you solving the next problem then you must have already solved the current/core problem
11. Give away other people products

#### Other People's Products
- Can the value of the other products outweigh the value of the current value in real world money?
- Affiliate references
    - Give you their product for free
    - Pay you to give away their products
        - Making money not only from customer directly
    - **4 levels:**
        1. Free (just give away)
        2. (Pre-negotiated discount or free period of time)
        3. (Pre-negotiated discount or free period of time) + affiliate commissions on sale
        4. (Pre-negotiated discount or free period of time AND exclusive features/licenses) + affiliate commissions on sale 


### 6. *Guarantee:*
#### Types of Guarantees
Always be **bold** about your Guarantees, no matter what they are. You should own your position.
> Have a process to minimize the company risk of Guarantee through activations of `A, B & C` that increase likelihood of success
- **Unconditional Guarantees**
    - No validation or reason required
        - Reverse the Risk (Counter the number 1 Objection)
        - Unconditional * Time (Make an Informed Decision/Verify that this works for you)
- **Conditional Guarantees**
    - Can seed the idea of commitment e.g. `within 6 months`
    - If you don't achieve `X` in `Y` time, we will `Z`
        - Must be realistic and reasonable to achieve
        - Examples of what `Z` could be:
            - Outsized Refund Guarantee (2x / 3x of the original cost)
            - Continued Service Guarantee until you achieve the `X` as long as you `A, B & C` (where `A, B & C` are activations that increase likelihood of success)
                - Can this be paid with additional payments e.g. preferred vendors (as you can be paid by preferred vendors)
            - Continued Modified Service Guarantee (get some of the service without of it for free)
            - Credit based Guarantee (Refund as Credit, Give credit to your other products/services)
            - Personalized Service Guarantee (One-on-One time increased value)
            - Pay for other costs (Hotel, Flights, Meals, Perks)
                - Make this conditional on Time to activate
            - Wage Payment Guarantee
            - Release of Service Guarantee
            - Delayed Second Payment Guarantee (Tie to activations)
            - First Outcome Guarantee (until you achieve `X` you don't have to pay again) 
- **Anti-Guarantees & Performance/Value Based Guarantees**
    - **Anti-Guarantees:** Explain why you cannot give refunds (e.g. "once seen you cannot un-see", "value already gotten")
    - **Performance/Value Based:** If the outcome is not achieved, there is no cost (All high performers want to be performant. No Cap on Value/Earnings)
        - Cost could get more by adding more value e.g. `Percentage of sales/growth` or `X` per `Unit`(kg, people, etc..)
- **Naming Guarantees**
    - Spice it up and use marketing wording, e.g. "if you wouldn't jump into shark infested water to keep our product, we will give you your money back"

#### Stacking Guarantees
use **Unconditional Guarantees** for short period e.g. 30 days + **Conditional Guarantees** for a the next period e.g. within 90 days (could stack multiple **Conditional Guarantees** as well)


### 7. *Scarcity and Urgency:*
Decrease time for people to make decisions (Units vs Time). Leverage supply and demand.
#### 1. Urgency: Time limitation
Purposefully Add a Feeling of limited time to act/get this deal
- **4 Types of Urgency:**
    - Rolling Cohorts/Grouping (e.g. new users, new session/group starting next week)
        - Natural Limit you can service at a time, use that to create Scarcity
        - Consider Natural Cadence
    - Seasonal (e.g. Spring, Winter, Valentines, Summer)
        - Change Flavour
        - Ending in...
    - Promotional / Pricing / Bonus (sale ending, future price increase)
        - Limit access
        - Changing package grouping
    - Exploding Opportunity (Opportunity is disappearing)
        - Shrink over time
#### 2. Scarcity: Unit limitation
Purposefully Limit Supply to Increase Demand (When demand increases, cut supply)
> Less Supply can also allow an increase in price per unit
- **3 Types of Scarcity:**
    - Limited Supply of Seats/Units
    - Limited Supply of Bonuses
    - Never available again / One-of-a-kind


### 8. *M-A-G-I-C Naming Formula:*
Ensure prospects KNOW that his is for them, and that it solves their problem, in the way they want it to be solved.
> Try to understand what Wallet/Budget someone is buying out of
#### Components
Try get them all in but at least 3 should be included
- **M:** Make a Magnetic Reason 
- **A:** Announcing the Avatar
- **G:** Give Them a Goal
- **I:** Indicate a Time-Interval
- **C:** Complete with a Container/Power Word/Phrase (Combines everything together, System)

#### Time Interval
Value is defined in speed to deliverable/desired outcome, not how much time you give them, and should be included in the Naming.

##### Bonuses 
Think about this as small steps towards a core transformation
- Change Time Intervals to smaller intervals for bonuses and ‚Äúsizzle‚Äù pieces. 
- Think in:
    - Seconds
    - Minutes
    - Hours

##### Core offer Promotions
Think about this as the core transformation
- Think in:
    - Days
    - Weeks
    - Months

#### Wrapping/Re-wrapping
Time is one of the most valuable and easiest metrics to address
**Refresh In Reverse order of difficulty and operational drag:**
- Change the creative (the images and pictures in your ads)
    - Change every 7 days
- Change the body copy in your ads
    - Change every 2/3 weeks
- Change the headline - the ‚Äúwrapper‚Äù/"framing" of your offer (1 month to 4 weeks)
    - Change every quarter
- Change the duration of your offer (1 month to 6 weeks)
    - Infrequent changes
    - Change once maybe twice a year at most but only if needed
- Change the enhancer of your offer (your free/discount component)
    - Constant and baked into many offers already
- Change the monetization structure, the series of offers you give prospects, and the price points associated with them (Book II)
    - Infrequent changes
    - Change every 2-3 years at most
