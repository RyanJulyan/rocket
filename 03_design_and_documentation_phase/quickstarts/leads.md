## Why Lead Magnets
A complete solution to a narrow problem given away at a significant discount (or free) to attract ideal customers
- Builds trust on you/your deliver and follow through
- Should lead to the "next problem" which your "Core offer" should then solve/address as described in the [What and Who](#what-and-who)
- Becuase they now trust you, they are more likely to buy from you

### A Great Lead Magnet:
- Engages Ideal Customer When they See it
- Gets more users to engage than your core offer alone (for the same effort, more people are likely to buy)
- A complete solution to a narrow problem (e.g. Step 1 of X)
- Is Valuable Enough people Actually use/Consume it
- Over Deliver on the promise of the Lead Magnet
- Makes the Right people more likely to buy

## What and Who
> Problem - Solution cycle
All problems when solved create new problem

1. Break the "Big problem" into "micro problems"/"steps" required to solve the problem especially the steps before 
2. Solve the very narrow `Micro Problem` (lead magnet)
    1. Make promise
    2. Deliver on promise
    3. Build trust
3. Although this helps it makes the other problem more obvious


## How to Solve the Lead Magnet
3 General Types of Lead Magnets:
1. Reveal the Problem
    - Assessment
    - Diagnosis
    - Great for problems that **get worse while/the longer you wait**
    - e.g.
        - Speed test on website
        - Termite inspection
        - Posture Analysis
2. Free Trial
    - Try and if you want more you must pay
    - Taste
    - Limit:
        - Number of uses
        - How much they get
        - Time they have access
        - All at once
        - e.g.
            - Faster server of website
            - Free back Adjustment
            - Consumables (Fun size/Sample): Food, Cosmetics
3. Free Step 1 of X
    - The rest are paid
    - "One of many steps`'
    - e.g.
        - First book in a series is free (e.g. The game of life kindle)
        - First video in a course is free
        - Free Garage door wood sealant - 1 of 3 coats
        - Free Course (must have follow up steps)
        - Free Calculator (must have follow up steps)
        - Free Template (must have follow up steps)

> Try to think about "How could I apply this in my offering"

Think about what is most likely to make a person take the next step, opening the packet of food (free step 1), or telling someone they are hungry (Reveal the Problem) will not make them want to buy, where buying is the next step. Tasting is more likely to make them want to buy then the other two.

4 General Approches to Deliver the Lead Magnets:
1. Software
    - **Give them a tool**
        - Does the job for them!
    - Highlight goal/comparison
        - Delta is the opportunity of sale/improvement
    - e.g.
        - Dashboard
        - Spreadsheet
2. Information
    - Teach them something
    - Try to over deliver on value, without doing EVERY step, your core offer should be the next step
    - e.g.
        - Courses
        - Lessons
        - Interviews with experts
        - Keynotes
        - Live events
        - Mistakes and Pitfalls
        - Hacks and Tips
3. Services
    - Do work for free
    - Get good will for giving away something other people know costs money to deliver
    - Good interface time with people during service time
    - e.g.
        - Run ads and get leads for free
4. Physical Products
    - Give something that can hold in hands


## Name the lead magnet
Frame/position in which they engage first and therefore the framing in which they will consume the information
The headline/title is 80% of the consumption from a user, and will determine if the next step is taken, `headline=name`

Use [M-A-G-I-C naming](https://github.com/RyanJulyan/rocket/blob/main/03_design_and_documentation_phase/quickstarts/offer_creation.md#8-m-a-g-i-c-naming-formula)

Consider A/B testing the performance. Make small changes to the headline to test preferred option. The following approaches could help :
- DM people on the list
- Make a post and ask people to comment
- Run Poll
- Run Ads
- Ask on multiple platforms?


## Make it Easy
People do things in the easiest, and most convenient way for them to consume. So give them options that work for them. e.g. Kindle, vs Book, vs Audio book, formats / devices (android, web, ios, app)

- **Software:** Accessible on Phone, Computer, Multiple Formats 
- **Infomration:** Use All consumption preferences (And multiple platforms e.g. podcast vs audible)
- **Services:** Available more times, in more ways, on more days
- **Physical Products:** Simple to get, open, use/consume (try make it memorable)


## Make it Good
No/Zero Fluff!

- Give away secrets, sell implementation.
- Have more than one valuable thing - be better (skill deficiency, so get better).
- Market judges you on your FREE stuff not paid (have an opinion, Free must be so good and over-deliver it builds reputation).
- People judge the value they'll get from your paid thing based on value of the free thing.
- Sucky fluff discourages people who would've bought not to.
- People buy based on expectation of future value. Easiest way to get them to think they'll get value after they buy is...provide value before they buy. 

## Create next steps
CALL TO ACTION! Engage Your Leads: Make it Easy To Ask For More

> This is Critical and should be carefully constructed, NOT an afterthought

1. **Make what to do next:** _clear_, simple, direct language
    - e.g. if you are IDP, do this (apply today) next
        - If you're a company doing $1M to $10M in profit, apply at Acquisition.com! 
2. **Give them a reasons to do it right now:** 
    - e.g.
        - We stopped taking companies for 5 months last year and recently opened back up.
        - Do it before we close up again.
    - Scarcity -> Urgency -> Reason Why (have a reason it is more compelling)
